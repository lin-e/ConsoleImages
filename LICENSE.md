1. You are explicitly forbidden to do the following:
  
  1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name. (ironic since I copied this from [DBAD] (https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad/blob/master/LICENSE-en.md))
  
  1b. Selling the unmodified original source with no work done what-so-ever. (You know who I'm talking about. Asshole.)
  
  1c. Modifying the original to hold malicious content.
  
  1d. Distributing (either free or commercial) anything with this source without proper credit (a link to this repository).
  
  1e. Claiming that this source is your own, anyone who I have copied code from, I've credited. Mostly.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love.

  2a. By this I mean you should donate me some Bitcoin. Seriously.
  
  2b. Additionally, if you were to distribute a modified source, it should be held under the same license, which allows us to all share code, and for all content creators to receive the credit they deserve.
  
  2c. I (lin-e) reserve the right to DMCA forks, source, compiled code, etc.

3. If there are any issues with the code, I will not be held liable.

  3a. Also if there are any bugs, and you fix them, please be a good person and share said fix.
  
4. I reserve the right to change anything listed here, without any prior notice.
